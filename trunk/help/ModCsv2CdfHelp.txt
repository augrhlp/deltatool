DELTATOOL_CSV2CDF 
Version 3.0 (22SEP2014)

The DELTATOOL_CSV2CDF is used to transform Model output in csv format into netCDF format for use in the DELTATOOL.

1. The MODcsv2cdf.sav file and the InfoMODcsv2cdf_*.txt files have been put in a directory called 'Home_Dir'. 

2. Click 'READInfo >>' to select the correct InfoMODcsv2cdf_*.txt file or the one that you want to change. All details are visualized under INPUT INFORMATION.

3. For changes in the input information modify the lines in white within the frame.
   - #STARTUP Full Path to Startup.ini file - See Description DELTATOOL
     D:\DELTATOOL\resource\startup.ini
   - #INIT_RUN    Starting date of the period to process (Starting hour is 0 on this day). 
                  Leapyear are taken into account. 
     20090225
   - #END_RUN    End date of the period to process (End hour is 23 on this day). 
                 Leapyear are taken into account. 
     20090326
   - #INPUT_DIR - Model output is input to the Preprocessor
     D:\DELTATOOL\Input\
   - FILE_ID - Model short name to be used in input file naming.
     CHIM
     The location and station-generic file names are indicated in grey. Format for these csv  
     files is axactly the same as for the Observational stations.
   - #OUTPUT_DIIR - Here to put the MODcsv2cdf output
     D:\DELTATOOL\Output\
   - #MODELNAME - structure is YEAR_MODEL_TIME.cdf 
     2009_MODEL_TIME.cdf
     Location and output file name are indicated in grey.

4. Information in the frame can be saved into a file called InfoMODcsv2cdf_xxx.txt 

5.  To start the process click 'GO', progress bar will be active

6.  Follow the process in the COMMENTS panel.

7.  The final result is the file YEAR_MODEL_TIME.cdf in OUTPUT_DIR with the  following example structure: 

 	netcdf  2009_CHIMERE_TIME {
	 	dimensions: 	
		  V = 6;
		  T = 720;
		  variables:
		    float Station1(T,V) ;
		    float Station2(T,V) ;
		    … ;
		  // global attributes:
		    : Parameters =  87b, 83b, … , 32b ;
                       : StartHour = 1320s ;
                       : EndHour = 2039s  ;
        }

        where V is the number of variables, 
              T number of hours in the period, 
              Parameters the byte format of the variables, for example: WS TEMP O3 PPM-10 PM10 DNOx,
              StartHour is the start hour in the period, 
              EndHour the end hour in the period.
